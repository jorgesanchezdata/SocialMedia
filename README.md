# SocialMedia

Social Media is a project analyzing popular social networks and their users interactions and trends.

About the Dataset:

This dataset provides a comprehensive and diverse snapshot of social media users and their engagements across various popular platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, and Spotify. With 100 rows of anonymized data, it offers valuable insights into the dynamic world of social media usage.

Each row in the dataset represents a unique user with a designated User ID and Username to ensure anonymity. Alongside user-specific details, the dataset captures essential information, including the platform being used, the post's content, timestamp, and media type (text, image, or video). Additionally, it tracks engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares/retweets, and user interactions, providing an overview of the user's popularity and social impact.
